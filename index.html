      <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
      <p>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a four-act play written by Thomas Russell Sullivan in collaboration with the actor Richard Mansfield (pictured). It is an adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, an 1886 novella by Robert Louis Stevenson. The story focuses on the respected London doctor Henry Jekyll, who uses a potion to transform into Edward Hyde, a loathsome criminal. Intrigued by the opportunity to play a dual role, Mansfield secured the stage rights and asked Sullivan to write the adaptation. The play debuted in Boston on May 9, 1887, then opened on Broadway in September of that year. Mansfield's performance as the dual character was acclaimed by critics. The play opened in London in August 1888, just before the first Jack the Ripper murders. Some press reports compared the murderer to the Jekyll-Hyde character, and Mansfield was suggested as a possible suspect. Mansfield's company continued to perform the play in the US until shortly before his death in 1907. Sullivan made changes from Stevenson's story that have been adopted by many subsequent adaptations, including several film versions that were derived from the play. (Full article...)</p>

      <h2>Today's featured picture</h2>
      <p>William J. Duane (1780–1865) was an Irish-born American politician and lawyer from Pennsylvania. Born in Clonmel, Duane emigrated to the United States with his parents and assisted his father in publishing the Aurora until 1806. After becoming an influential lawyer, he served several terms in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Duane served as United States Secretary of the Treasury for some four months in 1833; his refusal to withdraw Federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States led to his dismissal by President Andrew Jackson.</p>
